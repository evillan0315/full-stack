## ⚡ **Application Structure & Features**

The frontend is built using **SolidJS**, designed with modularity, scalability, and responsiveness in mind. It leverages:

* **SolidJS Router** for client-side routing with nested layouts.
* **Context Providers**:

  * `ThemeProvider` for light/dark theme management.
  * `AuthProvider` for authentication state and access control.
* **Protected Routes**:

  * Uses `<ProtectedRoute>` for safeguarding sensitive pages (e.g., dashboard, editor).
* **Dynamic Layout**:

  * Reusable `Layout` component with configurable header, footer, and navigation.
  * Supports fallback loading indicators via `Suspense`.
* **Global Services**:

  * `Toaster` for notifications.
  * `Modal` service for dialog management.

### 📌 **Routes Defined**

| `/builder`    | `Builder`      | Protected  | Dynamic form/code builder                            |
| `/generate`   | `GeneratePage` | Protected  | AI-assisted code/document generator                  |

## 🚀 **Additional Features**

* **Code Splitting**: Routes wrapped in `<Suspense>` for optimized loading.
* **Mobile & Desktop Ready**: Tailwind-based design for responsive layout.
* **Modal and Notification Services**: Modular services accessible throughout the app.
* **Environment-Aware**: Uses `import.meta.env` variables for API URLs and runtime configs.

---

## 📝 **Additional Notes**

* All protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
* The layout structure can easily accommodate additional headers, sidebars, or footers.
* Error handling is centralized at the route/component level.
* Consider adding **lazy loading** for components to further improve performance.
* Extendable with additional routes or providers with minimal changes.

### 🌐 Frontend Architecture

The frontend is powered by **SolidJS**, featuring:

- Client-side routing with protected and public paths.
- Context-based theme and authentication management.
- A dynamic layout system that supports global header, footer, and modal services.
- Code-splitting and lazy-loading ready (via `Suspense`).

#### 📂 Main Routes
- `/` → Public home
- `/login` → Authentication
- `/dashboard` → User dashboard (protected)
- `/editor` → Markdown/code editor (protected)
- `/downloader` → Media downloader with socket.io streaming (protected)
- `/tts` → Google Cloud Text-to-Speech form (protected)
- `/builder` → Dynamic form/code builder (protected)
- `/generate` → AI code/document generator (protected)

#### 🛠 Built-in Services
- **Toaster** → Real-time notifications.
- **Modal** → Centralized modal service.
- **SocketIO integration** → For streaming downloads & real-time updates.

> ⚠️ _All sensitive routes are guarded. Ensure API endpoints are secured on the backend as well._
